### 1. Introduction
MyMenu is a web application designed to demonstrate the creation of a dynamic menu using JavaScript. The menu items are stored in an array of objects, each containing properties such as id, title, category, price, img, and desc. The project emphasizes two main features: dynamic menu item generation and category-based filtering.

### 2. Features
- Dynamic Menu Display
The project utilizes JavaScript to dynamically generate HTML content for each menu item. By iterating through the menu array, the application constructs HTML markup for each item's image, title, price, and description. This approach ensures that menu items are displayed consistently and efficiently.

### 3. Category Filtering
MyMenu incorporates category filtering to enhance user experience. Users can select from different categories (e.g., breakfast, lunch, shakes) to filter the menu items accordingly. The application responds dynamically to the selected category, updating the displayed menu items in real-time.

### 4. Getting Started
- Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have a web browser installed on your computer.

### 5. Installation
- Clone the repository:
Copy code
git clone 

### 6. Usage
- Viewing Menu Items
Upon launching the application, the main menu section displays a collection of menu items. Each item includes an image, title, price, and description, providing users with an overview of the available options.

- Filtering by Category
To filter menu items by category:

- Use the category buttons located at the top of the menu section.
Click on a specific category button (e.g., "Breakfast," "Lunch," "Shakes") to filter the displayed menu items.
The menu section will update dynamically, showing only the items associated with the selected category.
